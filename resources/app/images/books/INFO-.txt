Hi thanks for downloading these Book icons. 

The folder contents are pretty much self explanatory, but for quick reference I will detail a few things in this info file.

The folder includes .png files and vectors. The .png files have been exported from the vector at 512ppixels by 512 pixels. I hope that this is big enough. If you need larger you can just grab them from the vector.

I've created a few generic themed spell books already, but I've also included lots of books without themes, just plain colours so you can add your own themes, names and logos or easily mapilulate thm in your photo editor of choice or directly in the vector. 

I hope you enjoy Using these sprites and that they serve your purpose. 

Thanks again!
